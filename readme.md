# Google Adsense Angular JS Test

This is a test of Google Adsense to debug issues with AngularJS.

For more information, please contact [Leonard Teo](leonard@artstation.com).

## Description of the problem
p AngularJS (created by Google) is a single-page-application framework. It loads in content dynamically without a full refresh of the DOM (Document Object Model). This appears to be incompatible with Adsense and DFP.

# To test this, switch between Page 1 and Page 2 several times. After about 5 impressions, it fails to load any more ads.
